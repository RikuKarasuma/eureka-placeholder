							<h3> Tips and Tricks: Securing your classes. The Final keyword in Java.</h3>
							<br>
							
							<p>
								One of the most overlooked principals in development among students and junior developers is scope. Namely class and package scope. In this article we will
								be going over how the Final keyword should be used to prevent unwanted access to classes or some methods within those classes. 
							</p>
							
							<p>
								I know what some of you are thinking. Wait can't we just access all classes, methods and variables using reflection anyway so wouldn't this be moot. Well 
								yes, by default if you didn't create a security manager to protect against unauthorised reflection use then your code is at huge risk even with access
								protections such as the keyword final. Always remember to create a security manager at the beginning of your application.  
							</p>

							<p>
								Now because the final keyword can be used four different ways, I'm going to state below those ways before we get into the meat of things. 
							</p>


							<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
								<li>A final class can't be sub-classed.</li>
								<li>A final method can't be overridden.</li>
								<li>A final variable can only be instantiated once.</li>
								<li>When an inner class is defined within a method, you must make all local method variables it uses from outside that inner class as final.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								We will be focusing on just the first two. Which if not used could lead to malicious implementations of that class if malicious code
								ever got within that JVM. 
							</p>
							<p>
								There are two reasons to get familiar with the word Final. One is to prevent access to the classes and method/s and two is to signal to other developers coming
								after you that a class, method or variable is immutable by design and should not be tampered with unless necessary.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								Here below we have our insecure class open to sub-classing by any object. Please follow the code comment to get an understanding of
								what is happening.
							</p>

							<br>
							<p>
								Now I will show you how the above class is exploited.
							</p>
							<br>
							<script src="https://gist.github.com/RikuKarasuma/d023e78c62996acd738a2500fc5c9e87.js"></script>
							<br>
							<p>
								In the next class we will see how to prevent the above two scenarios from occurring with just a single word. 
							</p>
							<br>
							<script src="https://gist.github.com/RikuKarasuma/6b99c97afa1d62fc1e0c424191c7c81a.js"></script>
							<br>
							<p>
								Realistically, we won't be able to make the class final all of the time. As we might need to override a method within for different implementations across
								our program. So instead we make it as tight-lipped as possible by defining every method we know won't be overridden as final. This plugs all security holes
								(From a design standpoint) except the ones we create ourselves. Below is an example of how we can protect just the methods we want.
