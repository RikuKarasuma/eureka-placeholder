							<h3 id="intro">What is LiamAutoMechanic?</h3>
							<p>
								liamautomechanic.com is a website created for a YouTuber with the same name. He approached me looking for a small website in order to heighten
	                			his online presence and provide an innovative tool creation service, from which he would design mechanic tools never conceived before to sell
	                			to his subscribers.
							</p>
							
							<a href="http://www.liamautomechanic.net">Click here to view the site.</a>

							<h3>Features</h3>
							<p>
				                The site was designed for selling tools using the PayPal API, forwarding users to mechanic tutorials on YouTube and using Google Adsense to
				                increase online advertising revenue.
							</p>

							<h3>Stage</h3>
							<p>
							  	The site has long since been finished. There is talk of continued development by adding more tools to sell although nothing has come of this yet.
							</p>

							<h3>Support</h3>
							<p>
							  	This site has my continued support in terms of Quality Assurance, Virtual Private Server and Domain management.
							</p>

							<h3>Roles, responsibilities & challenges</h3>
							<p>
				                My roles on this project were server developer, QA tester, website designer and administrator. My responsibilities were finding the perfect
				                VPS host, domain name provider, payment provider and posting new tools to sell whenever they are conceived.
							</p>
							<p>
				                The challenges in creating this website were setting up an Apache Http and Tomcat server via SSH. Payment integration was the most difficult
				                challenge of all, Paypals lagacy API was used, it was considered the most appropriate tool for the job as the robustness of their newer API
				                wasn't required.
			                </p>
				            <p>
				                The most interesting challenge I believe is the Paypal Notification workaround I had to develop because Paypal refuse to support Java Servlets
				                and the server was build upon Java. However they did support PHP, so I had to use a PHP script inbetween the HTTP and Tomcat Server. Once a
				                payment was received from the customer, paypal would notify a specific URL on the site which was not apart of the Tomcat Server, this script
				                would verify the payment with paypal and once verified would notify the Tomcat server that a payment has been received. The server would then
				                use the details from the customers paypal account to email the customer that their payment has been verified and that their product was on the
				                way.
