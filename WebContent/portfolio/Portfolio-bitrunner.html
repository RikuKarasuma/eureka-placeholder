							<h3 id="intro">What is BitRunner?</h3>
							<p>
							  BitRunner is a 2D Windows and Linux score orientated endless runner game. I was hired back in 2014 by a company called CoinBitsy to design and develop
							  their flagship game. They described their vision to me and I set out to develop this prototype.
							</p>

							<h3>Features</h3>
							<p>
							  BitRunner has multiple levels, difficulties and an original soundtrack by Stephen Devlin. The game has simple controls suchs as jump, roll and sprint.
							  The main concept was about timing, avoiding obsticles and gathering as many coins as you can before you die.
							</p>

							<h3>Stage</h3>
							<p>
							  The game unfortunately never left the beta stage. After two months of development, it was shaping up well and I had the go ahead to start developing
							  the CoinBitsy website platform which was going to contain the game leaderboards and serve adverts. Sadly, due to poor management issues and five months
							  of grueling work, the company disbanded, leaving this game as a relic to their vision.
							</p>

							<h3>Support</h3>
							<p>
							  There is no support or continued development on this game. Maybe in future I will revisit it and release it as shareware. However for now, it sits
							  gathering entropy in my hard disk.
							</p>

							<h3>Roles, responsibilities & challenges</h3>
							<p>
							  My role in the company and this project was lead developer and project manager. I was responsible for programming, QA, level design, graphic design and
							  ensuring the project stayed on schedule. The challenges were numerous and difficult. Animation cohesion was tough as well as managing the many different
							  states/mechanics the game had such as collision detection.
							</p>
							<p>
							  The biggest challenge of all was the timeframe. Every week I plotted and assigned the tasks that I and my team was going to try and achieve for that week
							  and bringing over the tasks we didn't finish the week before. The game was estimated for three months, there was of course many more features planned that
							  we didn't get to finish. Those were the ones that required a server platform that was going to be the CoinBitsy website.
							</p>

							<h3>Engine</h3>
							<p>
							  BitRunner is built upon an engine that I created some years ago while working on my side project Conquest Of Nerath called Firebolt. Version 1.0 of the engine
							  is based on the Slick2D framework, which is an extension of OpenGL bindings for Java(LWJGL). This ensures games created on the engine can be used on Windows
							  and Linux. It might work on Mac OS too, although I have not tested that assumption. Later the engine was ported to libGDX for Version 2.0, this was to ensure
							  portability on mobile devices such as IOS and Android. BitRunner uses version 1.0 of the engine as version 2.0 was not created until after BitRunner.
							</p>
							<center><a href="../images/bit-runner/bit-runner-graphics-menu.png"><img alt="BitRunner Game Engine" src="../images/bit-runner/bit-runner-graphics-menu.png" /></a></center>
							<p>
							  This is the graphics option menu. It pops up before the game starts. Here you can select from multiple graphics options such as Anti Aliasing, V Sync, Resolution,
							  Aspect Ratio and whether or not the game is fullscreen. All these options make a more customizable game experience for the end user.
							</p>
							<p>
							  Firebolt engine also allows users to add their own soundtracks to the game, as long as they are WAV or OGG format. These tracks will supplant the original
							  game music though.

							<h3>Main Menu</h3>
							<p>
							  The main menu is the entrance point of the game. It allows you to choose your level, adjust the games settings and then play, not necessarily in that order.
							</p>
							<p>
							  Bitman(The Avatar), runs constantly at the bottom left, this provides a seemless transition from the main menu to the game playing once the play button is
							  pressed as the game is already loaded before you reach the main menu.
							</p>
							<p>
							  At the bottom left you can choose from one of the eight levels available to the player.

							<h3>Settings Menu</h3>
							<p>
							  This is the options menu. A bit lackluster I know but it is a simplistic game after all. The two options available are difficulty and sound, as in the current
							  soundtrack playing.
							</p>
							<p>
							  The difficulty setting allows for controlling the speed which obsticles approach Bitman. There are three options, easy, normal and hardcore. Each one is drastically
							  different in difficulty but will allow you to test yourself and how good you are getting at the game.
							</p>
							<p>
							  The sound option allows for the switching of four separate soundtracks. Once a track has ended another will be randomly chosen. When Bitman dies, you can go back to
							  the settings menu and switch to the track you prefer. The tracks were composed by Steven Devlin.

							<h3>Playing</h3>
							<p>
							  Here we have the game. We control Bitman by using W to jump, S to roll and D to sprint. At the top is the stats which record your current amount of collected coins and
							  your total collected coins during the session.
							</p>
							<p>
							  You might be wondering why the obsticles are images of celebrities faces. We had them as just red squares beforehand. The manager thought it would be a funny idea to add
							  them as an option. We never got around to adding the option slider though. Anyway, there are four positions from which the enemies/obsticles come flying at Bitman, some
							  will require you to jump over or roll under them.
							</p>
							<p>
							  Once an enemy passes Bitman and exits the screen, it is destroyed. Then a new one is created offscreen to the far left and given a new random speed. The speed range depends
							  on the difficultly. No more than four obsticles are allowed on screen at once, anymore than that and unescapable situations can occur.
							</p>
							<p>
							  The game uses a form of parallax scrolling to achieve the illusion of movement. Bitman doesn't actually move(Unless you jump, then he winds back into his original position),
							  instead it's the background and obsticles that move. Once the sprint button is held, the speed of these objects increase, again giving the illusion of faster movement. This
							  is a great way to avoid creating entire repetitive levels and thus saves on heap space and processing power because we don't have to load everything at once or a bit at a
							  time.
